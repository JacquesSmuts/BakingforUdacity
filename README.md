# BakingforUdacity

## Instructions I am following to build this app

The app must show recipes to the user, matching mockups provided by Udacity here: https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd801/parts/fbf60bf4-6f2f-45c4-ba0a-4f5ada90d2ae/modules/fef52d54-0038-4a84-9d11-feedc914d310/lessons/8703012d-d830-4748-bb64-ae1796d687ec/concepts/16d87c7d-a648-4c0c-be4e-e88fb5f1ac6b

Use the JSON acquired from here as data source: https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/May/59121517_baking/baking.json

The app must fulfill the Rubric here: https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/829/view
